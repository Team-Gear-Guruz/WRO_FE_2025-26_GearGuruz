# Electromechanical Diagrams
This folder documents the **wiring, control logic, and behavior** of our WRO Future Engineers vehicle.  
The diagrams show how the **Raspberry Pi (vision + decision-making)**, **Arduino (actuator control)**, and **sensors/motors** all work together.  
At a high level:
- The **Raspberry Pi** runs computer vision and calculates corrections using **PD Control**.  
- A **Finite State Machine (FSM)** decides when to switch between lane following, obstacle avoidance, turning, and parking.  
- The **Arduino** executes commands from the Pi, controlling motors, servo steering, and ultrasonic sensors.

## PD Control (Steering)
Our vehicle uses a **Proportionalâ€“Derivative (PD) Controller** to keep itself centered in the lane.

**PD Control Formula:**
```
u(t) = Kp Ã— e(t) + Kd Ã— de(t)/dt
```

- **e(t)** â†’ Lane error (distance from the center of the track)  
- **Kp (Proportional Gain)** â†’ Corrects based on how far the car is off-center  
- **Kd (Derivative Gain)** â†’ Corrects based on how fast the error is changing (prevents zig-zagging)  
- **u(t)** â†’ Steering correction applied to the servo  

This ensures smooth, stable lane following without overshooting.

## FSM (Finite State Machine)
High-level behavior is managed by an **FSM**, which switches states depending on sensor and camera input.

**States:**
- **Lane Following** â†’ Default, uses camera + PD control  
- **Obstacle Avoidance** â†’ Triggered when obstacles detected  
- **Turn Around** â†’ Used if the path is completely blocked  
- **Parking** â†’ Activated when magenta parking zone is detected

## Control Logic Summary

1. **Vision Processing** (Raspberry Pi)
   - Captures frames at 30 FPS
   - Detects lane lines using color masking
   - Identifies obstacles (red/green blocks)
   - Recognizes parking zones (magenta)

2. **Decision Making** (FSM on Pi)
   - Evaluates current state
   - Checks sensor data
   - Determines next action

3. **Actuation** (Arduino)
   - Receives commands via serial
   - Controls motor speed/direction
   - Adjusts steering servo
   - Monitors ultrasonic sensors

4. **Feedback Loop**
   - Sensor data sent back to Pi
   - PD controller adjusts steering
   - FSM updates state if needed

## Notes
- The system runs at **10Hz update rate** for real-time responsiveness
- PD gains are tuned empirically: **Kp = 0.8**, **Kd = 0.3**
- Ultrasonic sensors have **2-400cm range** with 3mm resolution
- Servo steering range: **-30Â° to +30Â°** from center
