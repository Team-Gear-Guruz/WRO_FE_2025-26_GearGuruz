# ⚡ Electromechanical Diagrams

This folder documents the **wiring, control logic, and behavior** of our WRO Future Engineers vehicle.  
The diagrams show how the **Raspberry Pi (vision + decision-making)**, **Arduino (actuator control)**, and **sensors/motors** all work together.  

At a high level:
- The **Raspberry Pi** runs computer vision and calculates corrections using **PD Control**.  
- A **Finite State Machine (FSM)** decides when to switch between lane following, obstacle avoidance, turning, and parking.  
- The **Arduino** executes commands from the Pi, controlling motors, servo steering, and ultrasonic sensors.

## ⚙️ PD Control (Steering)

Our vehicle uses a **Proportional–Derivative (PD) Controller** to keep itself centered in the lane.

\[
u(t) = K_p \cdot e(t) + K_d \cdot \frac{de(t)}{dt}
\]

- **e(t)** → Lane error (distance from the center of the track)  
- **Kp (Proportional Gain)** → Corrects based on how far the car is off-center  
- **Kd (Derivative Gain)** → Corrects based on how fast the error is changing (prevents zig-zagging)  
- **u(t)** → Steering correction applied to the servo  

👉 This ensures smooth, stable lane following without overshooting.

## 🧩 FSM (Finite State Machine)

High-level behavior is managed by an **FSM**, which switches states depending on sensor and camera input.

**States:**
- **Lane Following** → Default, uses camera + PD control  
- **Obstacle Avoidance** → Triggered when obstacles detected  
- **Turn Around** → Used if the path is completely blocked  
- **Parking** → Activated when magenta parking zone is detected
